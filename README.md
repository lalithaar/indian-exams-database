# üéì IndiaExams Database

**Find the exam you didn't know existed (but probably should take)**

Ever spent hours googling "entrance exams for [your field]" and found the same 5 popular ones mentioned everywhere? Yeah, India has *way* more exams than that.

## The Problem
You're interested in marine biology, forest research, textile design, or some niche engineering field. You know there must be specialized exams and opportunities out there, but Google just keeps showing you JEE, NEET, CAT, and UPSC. Meanwhile, there are dozens of lesser-known exams that could actually be perfect for your goals.

## The Solution
A simple, searchable database of Indian exams across all fields - from the obvious ones everyone knows to the hidden gems that could change your career path. No ads, no affiliate links, just straight information with source links so you can verify everything.

**Simple version:** We collect exam info so you don't have to hunt through 47 different websites to find what you're looking for.

## What's Here

- **Engineering:** Beyond JEE - state exams, specialized branches, PSU recruitments
- **Medical & Life Sciences:** NEET alternatives, research fellowships, specialized health programs  
- **Research & Academia:** NET-JRF variants, institute-specific fellowships, doctoral programs
- **Finance & Banking:** From CFA to cooperative bank officer exams
- **Creative Fields:** Design, media, arts - the exams art schools don't tell you about
- **Government Services:** Beyond UPSC - state PSCs, specialized recruitment boards
- **And more:** Because India loves its competitive exams

## How to Use

Just browse the folders or use our simple search:
- Filter by field, education level, or exam frequency

## üöß Work in Progress üöß

This started because I was tired of discovering important exams *after* their deadlines passed. Figured other students might want this too.

Currently building:
- Better search functionality
- Deadline reminders 
- State-wise filtering
- Mobile-friendly interface
