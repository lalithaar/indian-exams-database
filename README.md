**Find the exam you didn't know existed (but probably should take)**

Ever spent hours googling "entrance exams for [your field]" and found the same 5 popular ones mentioned everywhere? Yeah, India has *way* more exams than that.

## The Problem
You're interested in marine biology, forest research, textile design, or some niche engineering field. You know there must be specialized exams and opportunities out there, but Google just keeps showing you JEE, NEET, CAT, and UPSC. Meanwhile, there are dozens of lesser-known exams that could actually be perfect for your goals.

## The Solution

**Simple version:** We collect exam info so you don't have to hunt through 47 different websites to find what you're looking for.

## What's Here

- **Research & Academia:** NET-JRF variants, institute-specific fellowships, doctoral programs
